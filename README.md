In general, there are different options to deploy ML models, such as Flask, Django, Streamlit, etc.
I will use Streamlit because it is the easiest and faster way to do it and it does not require any web development knowledge.

There are three main python files to build the application.

main.py, model.py, prediction.py


1- model.py — Build ML model and Save it.
2. prediction.py — Test saved ML model.
3. main.py — the main file to run the web app.

Step 1: Create a new virtual environment using Pycharm IDE.

Step 2: Install necessary libraries.

Step 3: Build the best machine learning model and Save it.

Step 4: Test the loaded model.

Step 5: Create main.py file

Step 5.2: Load saved label encoder classes

Step 5.3: Load saved the best model

Step 5.4: Show dataframe on the web

Step 5.5: Select Fish Species

Step 5.6: Select each value of features using a slider window

Step 5.7: Make prediction button

Step 6: Upload local project to Github

Step 7: Create an account on Streamlit
